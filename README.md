From the given list of anime, you  can type a number corresponding to an anime and a torrent client will be opened to start downloading 
### **NOTE:** Right now you need to specify the path to the your torrent client if you dont have qBittorrent installed, because path to the torrent client is hardcoded as C:\Program Files\qBittorrent\qbittorrent.exe

## Make a Watchlist
![alt text](https://github.com/RainbowDog98/Erai-raws-anime-parser/blob/master/Images/watchlistDisplay.png)
You can make a watchlist by adding anime to it, It will track: 
* What anime you are watching right now
* If you have dowloaded it (it will be displayed in magenta color if it's not and cyan color if it is)
* Approximately when the new anime will be released 

And thats about it :^)
